<h2>Global Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#global-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge
directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by
using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available config settings and their comments inside the global.conf file. Note that certain sections
will not be filled immediately, and may optionally be added to the file when the server encounters them. There’s also
full example of an unmodified <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">global.conf</span></code> file at the bottom of this page, below the following list:</p>

<dt>capture-async-spawning-entities</dt>
<dd>If set to ‘true’, when a mod or plugin attempts to spawn an entity
off the main server thread, Sponge will automatically
capture said entity to spawn it properly on the main
server thread. The catch to this is that some mods are
not considering the consequences of spawning an entity
off the server thread, and are unaware of potential race
conditions they may cause. If this is set to false,
Sponge will politely ignore the entity being spawned,
and emit a warning about said spawn anyways.</dd>
<dt>generate-stacktrace-per-phase</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, more thorough debugging for PhaseStates
such that a StackTrace is created every time a PhaseState
switches, allowing for more fine grained troubleshooting
in the cases of runaway phase states. Note that this is
not extremely performant and may have some associated costs
with generating the stack traces constantly.</dd>
<dt>maximum-printed-runaway-counts</dt>
<dd>If verbose is not enabled, this restricts the amount of
runaway phase state printouts, usually happens on a server
where a PhaseState is not completing. Although rare, it should
never happen, but when it does, sometimes it can continuously print
more and more. This attempts to placate that while a fix can be worked on
to resolve the runaway. If verbose is enabled, they will always print.</dd>
<dt>verbose</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, the phase tracker will print out when there are too many phases
being entered, usually considered as an issue of phase re-entrance and
indicates an unexpected issue of tracking phases not to complete.
If this is not reported yet, please report to Sponge. If it has been
reported, you may disable this.</dd>
<dt>verbose-errors</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, the phase tracker will dump extra information about the current phases
when certain non-PhaseTracker related exceptions occur. This is usually not necessary, as the information
in the exception itself can normally be used to determine the cause of the issue</dd>

at it, but Vanilla (SpongeVanilla implementation) does NOT
have any of the patch, leading to the recommendation that this
patch is enabled “for sure” when using SpongeVanilla implementation.

<dt>auto-player-save-interval</dt>
<dd>The auto-save tick interval used when saving global player data. (Default: 900)
Note: 20 ticks is equivalent to 1 second. Set to 0 to disable.</dd>
<dt>auto-save-interval</dt>
<dd>The auto-save tick interval used to save all loaded chunks in a world.
Set to 0 to disable. (Default: 900)
Note: 20 ticks is equivalent to 1 second.</dd>
<dt>chunk-gc-load-threshold</dt>
<dd>The number of newly loaded chunks before triggering a forced cleanup.
Note: When triggered, the loaded chunk threshold will reset and start incrementing.
Disabled by default.</dd>
<dt>chunk-gc-tick-interval</dt>
<dd>The tick interval used to cleanup all inactive chunks that have leaked in a world.
Set to 0 to disable which restores vanilla handling. (Default: 600)</dd>
<dt>chunk-unload-delay</dt>
<dd>The number of seconds to delay a chunk unload once marked inactive. (Default: 15)
Note: This gets reset if the chunk becomes active again.</dd>
<dt>deny-chunk-requests</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, any request for a chunk not currently loaded will be denied (exceptions apply
for things like world gen and player movement).
Warning: As this is an experimental setting for performance gain, if you encounter any issues
then we recommend disabling it.</dd>
<dt>flowing-lava-decay</dt>
<dd>Lava behaves like vanilla water when source block is removed</dd>
<dt>gameprofile-lookup-batch-size</dt>
<dd>The amount of GameProfile requests to make against Mojang’s session server. (Default: 1)
Note: Mojang accepts a maximum of 600 requests every 10 minutes from a single IP address.
If you are running multiple servers behind the same IP, it is recommended to raise the ‘gameprofile-task-interval’ setting
in order to compensate for the amount requests being sent.
Finally, if set to 0 or less, the default batch size will be used.
For more information visit <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.vg/Mojang_API">http://wiki.vg/Mojang_API</a></dd>
<dt>gameprofile-lookup-task-interval</dt>
<dd>The interval, in seconds, used by the GameProfileQueryTask to process queued GameProfile requests. (Default: 4)
Note: This setting should be raised if you experience the following error:
“The client has sent too many requests within a certain amount of time”.
Finally, if set to 0 or less, the default interval will be used.</dd>
<dt>generate-spawn-on-load</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, this world will generate its spawn the moment its loaded.</dd>
<dt>infinite-water-source</dt>
<dd>Vanilla water source behavior - is infinite</dd>
<dt>invalid-lookup-uuids</dt>

Note: If you are using SpongeForge, make sure to enter any mod fake player’s UUID to this list.</dd>
<dt>item-merge-radius</dt>
<dd>The defined merge radius for Item entities such that when two items are
within the defined radius of each other, they will attempt to merge. Usually,
the default radius is set to 0.5 in Vanilla, however, for performance reasons
2.5 is generally acceptable.
Note: Increasing the radius higher will likely cause performance degradation
with larger amount of items as they attempt to merge and search nearby
areas for more items. Setting to a negative value is not supported!</dd>
<dt>keep-spawn-loaded</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, this worlds spawn will remain loaded with no players.</dd>
<dt>leaf-decay</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, natural leaf decay is allowed.</dd>
<dt>load-on-startup</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, this world will load on startup.</dd>
<dt>max-chunk-unloads-per-tick</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of queued unloaded chunks that will be unloaded in a single tick.
Note: With the chunk gc enabled, this setting only applies to the ticks
where the gc runs (controlled by ‘chunk-gc-tick-interval’)
Note: If the maximum unloads is too low, too many chunks may remain
loaded on the world and increases the chance for a drop in tps. (Default: 100)</dd>
<dt>mob-spawn-range</dt>
<dd>Specifies the radius (in chunks) of where creatures will spawn.
This value is capped to the current view distance setting in server.properties</dd>
<dt>portal-agents</dt>
<dd>A list of all detected portal agents used in this world.
In order to override, change the target world name to any other valid world.
Note: If world is not found, it will fallback to default.</dd>

<dd>If ‘true’, this world will allow PVP combat.</dd>
<dt>view-distance</dt>
<dd>Override world distance per world/dimension
The value must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 32
The server-wide view distance will be used when the value is -1.</dd>
<dt>weather-ice-and-snow</dt>
<dd>If ‘true’, natural formation of ice and snow in supported biomes will be allowed.</dd>
<dt>weather-thunder</dt>
