Installing Sponge
=================

Overview
========

Recall that there are two official variants of Sponge (SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla) â€” they both run Sponge plugins
identically (that's the goal), but how either work behind the scenes (the code) differs. This is better explained in
the :doc:`implementations/index` page.

Instructions for both are listed on this page.

You will also need to :doc:`install Java <jre>`. To recap, Java 8 is the minimum version required; older versions (ie Java 6 and 7) are no longer supported.

Installing SpongeForge
======================

.. note::

    If you use (or are planning to use) a game server host, they may have a control panel that can install Sponge for you.

Single Player / In-Game LAN Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the Minecraft Forge installer from the `Minecraft Forge website <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_. The
   latest version, or any version that's newer than the one listed :doc:`in the filename of the Sponge download
   <implementations/spongeforge>`, should work.
#. Run the provided Forge installer. A new Forge profile will be created in the Minecraft launcher.
#. Open the Minecraft launcher, and select the new Forge profile.
#. Click "Options" and click "Open Game Dir".
#. Download SpongeForge from the Sponge website and put it into the ``mods`` folder. Create the folder if it does
   not yet exist.
#. Sponge should work in both in single player and if you open your world to LAN.

Next, learn how you can create and use a :doc:`launch-script <launch-script>`, how to
:doc:`configure Sponge <configuration/index>` and how to :doc:`manage your server <../management/index>`
(including installing plugins).

Dedicated Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you already have a Forge server, just put the Sponge mod into your ``mods`` folder. Remember to update your Forge
    version if it's older than the one that :doc:`sponge requires <implementations/spongeforge>`.

Via GUI
--------

1. Download the Minecraft Forge installer from the `Minecraft Forge website <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_. The
   latest version, or any version that's newer than the one listed :doc:`in the filename of the Sponge download
   <implementations/spongeforge>`, should work.
#. Run the provided Forge installer, select "Install Server", choose an empty folder to place the server's files,
   and then click OK.
#. Download SpongeForge from the Sponge website and put it into the ``mods`` folder in your server directory.
   Create the folder if it does not yet exist.
#. You may now launch the server via command or launch script ``java -jar forge-version-XYZ.jar``.
#. Set up :doc:`port-forward` to ensure others can connect.

Next, learn :doc:`how you can configure Sponge <configuration/index>` and how to :doc:`how to manage your server
<../management/index>` (including installing plugins).


Installing SpongeVanilla
========================

SpongeVanilla only works as a dedicated server.

1. Download the SpongeVanilla .jar from the Sponge website.
#. Run it via command line: ``java -jar spongevanilla-whatever.jar``
#. Set up :doc:`port-forward` to ensure others can connect.

.. warning::

    Don't double-click the ``.jar`` file!
