    If you use (or are planning to use) a third-party dedicated server or shared hosting, you may be provided with a panel to aid in the management of your server. It may be unnecessary to follow the instructions detailed below, depending on what is provided by your host.

#. Open the Minecraft launcher, and select the new Forge profile.
#. Click "Options" and click "Open Game Dir".
