Installing Sponge
=================

Overview
========

The intent of this article is to help new server owners install Sponge. Please note that the process described here may vary depending on the platform used.

Installing Sponge (coremod)
===========================

.. note::

    If you use (or are planning to use) a third-party dedicated server or shared hosting, you may be provided with a panel to aid in the management of your server. It may be unnecessary to follow the instructions detailed below, depending on what is provided by your host.

Single Player LAN Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the correct Forge release for your Minecraft version from the `Minecraft Forge website <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_. Sponge should be compatible with the latest 1.8 Forge build. If you're unsure which version to choose, take a look here: :doc:`implementations/sponge`
#. Run the provided Forge installer. A new Forge profile will be created in the Minecraft launcher.
#. Open the Minecraft launcher, and select the new Forge profile.
#. Click "Options" and click "Open Game Dir".
#. Download the Sponge coremod from the Sponge website and put it into the ``mods`` folder. Create the folder if it does not yet exist.
#. You may now open a single-player world to LAN.

New Forge Server Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the correct Forge release for your Minecraft version from the `Minecraft Forge website <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_. Sponge should be compatible with the latest 1.8 Forge build. If you're unsure which version to choose, take a look here: :doc:`implementations/sponge`
#. Run the provided Forge installer, and select "Install Server" in a clean directory.
#. Download the Sponge coremod from the Sponge website and put it into the ``mods`` folder in your server directory. Create the folder if it does not yet exist.
#. You may now launch the server via command or launch script ``java -jar forge-version-XYZ.jar``.
#. Set up :doc:`port-forward` to ensure others can connect.

Headless Forge Server Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sponge.jar file now has command-line functionality, and can be used to install and launch a server. 
Please note that installing Forge, and using Sponge as a mod, should always be the preferred course of action for most users. The self-installer is primarily intended for headless servers.

The commands required to set up and run the server are:

* ``java -jar sponge.jar install``
* ``java -jar sponge.jar run``

There is also a command which does both:

* ``java -jar sponge.jar go``

Existing Forge Server Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obtain the Sponge coremod from the Sponge website and place it into your server's ``mods`` folder.

.. tip::

    Developer Me4502 has provided a `tutorial video for installing Sponge (coremod). <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTIyjjO6lxY>`__


Installing SpongeVanilla
========================

1. Download the SpongeVanilla .jar from the Sponge website.
#. Run it via CMD: ``java -jar spongevanilla-whatever.jar``
#. Set up :doc:`port-forward` to ensure others can connect.

.. warning::

    Don't double-click the ``.jar`` file!
