====================
Migrating from Forge
====================

Overview
========

The intent of this article is to help people who currently run Forge servers to migrate to Sponge.

Instructions
============

Migrating from a plain Forge server to a Sponge server is a fairly simple process that needs little-to-no preparatory work.

You must first ensure you are running a version of Forge that is compatible with the version of Sponge your plan to use. You may find recommended builds of Forge at http://files.minecraftforge.net. If you are using any other mods, they must also be updated.

When you are ready to install Sponge, you may proceed with the following steps:

1. Stop your Forge server if it is running.
#. Download the Sponge coremod from the Sponge website.
#. Place the Sponge coremod into your ``mods`` folder.
#. Start the server and party!

.. note::

    If Sponge is the only mod on your server, players will be able to log in with a vanilla client. Other mods may require players to install Forge on their own computers.

The Next Step
=============

The guide at :doc:`../../../../server/getting-started/installation` provides further information for your adventures with Sponge.
