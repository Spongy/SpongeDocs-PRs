======================
Migrating from Vanilla
======================

Overview
========

The intent of this article is to help people who currently run vanilla servers to migrate to Sponge.

Administrators of vanilla Minecraft servers can migrate to Sponge easily because Forge, and thus Sponge, uses the same world structure as vanilla Minecraft. Sponge also uses the same files used by vanilla Minecraft, such as ``server.properties``.

Installing Sponge
=================

The guide at :doc:`../../../../server/getting-started/installation` provides instructions for installing Sponge.
