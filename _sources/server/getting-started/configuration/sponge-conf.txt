Global Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge
directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by
using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds. The following global.conf example was generated by a server
running SpongeForge (build 516) and Forge 1.8 (build 1487).

Sponge SQL Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponge provides a rudimentary SQL service. The SQL properties are *not* created in the default global.conf file, and
must be added by *manually* editing the file. This service permits assigning keys in the config file that can then be
used by plugins.

**Aliases**

The keys define aliases (ie. key=url) for database connection URLs. These aliases can be used in place of database URLs
in any plugin configuration that uses the Sponge services to establish database connections. An example of the completed
SQL settings is provided below.

.. code-block:: none

    databases {
        # Provides database URLs for use by plugins
        key="jdbc:mysql://user:pass@host/database"
        localdb="jdbc:h2:config/myplugin/database.db"
    }
