Global Configuration
--------------------

The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds. The following global.conf example was generated by a server running Sponge Coremod (build 516) and Forge 1.8 (build 1487).
