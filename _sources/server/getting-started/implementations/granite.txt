=======

    Granite is a vanilla implementation of the Sponge API as a stand-alone server.


Overview
========

Granite is an implementation of the Sponge API that is created by patching the vanilla Minecraft server. This means it is a stand-alone server, and does not utilise nor require Minecraft Forge or Forge mod loader (FML).
Granite is being developed in parallel to the Forge version of Sponge, as an alternative platform for users who do not want to run a Forge server. Originally started as an independent project by developers **AzureusNation** and **VoltaSalt**, the Granite team officially joined the Sponge development team in March 2015.
