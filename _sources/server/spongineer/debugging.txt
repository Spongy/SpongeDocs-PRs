Debugging
=========

Logs are an essential part when it comes to debugging your server and figuring what went wrong. This page will show
some basic logging examples and will try to explain what you can do to fix your issues, when encountering them.

General Warnings
================

A common source of errors and bugs is a version mismatch between either SpongeForge and Forge or
SpongeForge and Plugins. First we'll have a look at the general warning Forge gives us upon crashing:

.. code-block:: none

 WARNING: coremods are present:
    SpongeForge (sponge-1.8-1521-2.1DEV-750.jar)
 Contact their authors BEFORE contacting forge

This isn't a bug or error, it's just Forge telling you that a Coremod (here: SpongeForge) is installed. Forge advises
you to contact the Sponge developers first, before asking the Forge support for help. Nothing to worry about here.

Common Exceptions
=================

Here are some common exceptions and some reasons why you might encounter them:

Mismatched SpongeForge and Forge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

 [12:59:21] [main/ERROR] [mixin/]: @Mixin target net.minecraftforge.event.world.BlockEvent$NeighborNotifyEvent was not found mixins.forge.core.json:event.block.MixinEventNotifyNeighborBlock

This is a common crash when you try to run SpongeForge on the wrong Forge build. Note that the target/Mixin can vary.
Always match Forge against SpongeForge! If you're unsure which version of Forge is required and you already got your
SpongeForge build, take a look at: :doc:`../getting-started/implementations/spongeforge/`

Other common errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

 Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.spongepowered.api.event.state.ServerStartedEvent
 Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

The first error indicates that a ``Class`` is missing, the second is a NullPointer Exception which indicated that the
plugin you're trying to use relies on missing parameters. This happens when you try to run and older plugin on a newer
SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla build and vice versa.

.. code-block:: none

 [Server thread/ERROR] [Sponge]: Could not pass ChangeBlockEvent$Break$Impl to SpongePlugin:AwesomePlugin{1.33.7}
 java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/spongepowered/api/block/BlockTransaction

A ``NoClassDefFoundError`` occurs when the plugin tries to access a class that isn't on the classpath. This happens
when the API got adjusted or refactored lately. Both errors often occur when you're trying to run an older plugin
on a newer build of SpongeForge and vice versa. Always try to use the correct version!

.. code-block:: none

 java.lang.AbstractMethodError: net.minecraft.entity.player.EntityPlayerMP.getTabList()Lorg/spongepowered/api/entity/living/player/tab/TabList;
 at (...)

An ``AbstractMethodError`` occurs when a plugin tries to call a method which isn't implemented yet. Please check if you're
running the most current build of Sponge and update if a newer version is available. If the problem still exists, either
report it on the official Issuetracker, on the forums or on IRC. You can request the implementation of the missing
feature too.

.. code-block:: none

 java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/spongepowered/api/data/DataManipulator

This error is encountered when your using an older or newer Sponge build than the Plugin was built against. Likely some
parts of the API changed, which the plugin was relying on. Either ask the Plugin author which Sponge version he build
against or try updating/downgrading your SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla to solve this.
