Logfiles are an essential part when it comes to debugging your server and figuring what went wrong. This pages contains
logfiles from SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla servers including short descriptions.

SpongeForge logfiles
====================

SpongeForge writes several logfiles to the ``/logs`` folder located inside your servers directory. As of Forge 1521
these are:

1. ``fml-junk-earlystartup.log``
#. ``fml-server-latest.log``
#. ``latest.log``

fml-junk-earlystartup.log
