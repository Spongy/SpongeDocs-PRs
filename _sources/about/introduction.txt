What is Sponge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the Sponge project is to create a plugin development framework for Minecraft. Sponge is being created by a global community, and its open-source nature means anyone can participate.

Sponge was created after seeing the failures of other projects in the Minecraft plugin development community. We are trying to avoid making the same mistakes as other projects; thus:

* Sponge is an extremely open project.
* Sponge is licensed under the MIT license - an extremely permissive open source license.
* Performance is of high priority.

Most plugins developed with the Sponge API should work across several different versions of Minecraft without needing to be updated. This means that, for the most part, server owners do not need to worry about plugin incompatibilities.

We have another project in addition to the Sponge API. It is the Sponge coremod for Forge, often referred to as simply “Sponge.” Sponge runs on Minecraft Forge, which is an existing Minecraft modding framework famous for spurring the Minecraft modding scene. Forge lacks a cross-version API, and this is where Sponge steps in. Sponge allows server owners to deploy Sponge plugins with ease, making server management easier.

Players on servers running Sponge do not need to install any client-side mods. They are able to join servers running Sponge using the vanilla Minecraft client provided by Mojang.

Although the official Sponge implementation runs on Minecraft Forge, the Sponge API is not tied to any platform. This means that server owners run Sponge plugins on any implementation of the Sponge API, such as Granite (a third-party vanilla implementation).

Where can I download Sponge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sponge coremod is not ready yet, and no download is available. The Sponge API, however, was released on November 30, 2014.

Who is behind Sponge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project leaders are blood, sk89q, and Zidane. We are trying to be very open with the team to ensure the project leaders do not end up “holding all of the keys.” Nonetheless, these three people make the final decisions to ensure the efficient operation of the project.

Each aspect of the Sponge project is led by a different individual:

* Sponge API development is led by **Zidane**.
* Sponge coremod development is led by **blood**.
* Ore development is led by **gratimax**.
* SpongeDocs is coordinated by **Inscrutable**.
* Support is coordinated by **Owexz**.

Our developers are well-versed with Java, and many of them have worked with Minecraft for years and know the ins-and-outs of its mechanics. There are tons of very good developers working on the Sponge project, and it would be nearly impossible to list all of them!
