Forum Posting Guidelines

Read Before Posting
-------------------

If you are confused or curious about Sponge, we strongly recommend reading the `FAQ <about/faq>`__. Please refrain from posting topics asking for basic information about Sponge, like *"Is Sponge a Forge mod"*, *"When will Sponge be released"*, etc. Answers to those questions can be found here in SpongeDocs.

Before you post a new topic on Sponge Forums, please make sure it's not redundant questions or information! Use the Search feature (top right of page) or check the ``Your topic is similar to...`` box that appears above the pane when creating a new topic (it updates as you add stuff to your topic). If there is a similar topic, you should probably continue your discussion there! Discussions about other APIs are allowed so long as they don't turn nasty.

Still need more info? Take a look at the `Sponge Resources <index>`__, check the `Forum Announcements <https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/announcements>`__, or to track Sponge's progress, `follow them on Twitter <https://twitter.com/SpongePowered>`__ or watch `Sponge GitHub <https://github.com/SpongePowered>`__. More information concerning contributing to Sponge is collected  `here <https://docs.spongepowered.org/en/contributing/index.html>`__.

Categorizing Your Posts
-----------------------

When creating new topics, use the drop down menu to the right of the topic title to set it's category. Try to make sure this category fits what you're posting about. If you don't know what a category implies, a description is next to each one in the drop down.
