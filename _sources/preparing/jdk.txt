==================
Installing the JDK
==================

Overview
========

The Java Development Kit - also known as the JDK - is required in order to develop Sponge plugins and/or work on Sponge itself.

Download
========

Before installing the JDK, uninstall any older versions of Java that are present on your computer.

.. note::

    Sponge contributors must use JDK 6 at present to preserve compatibility with underlying implementation. For Plugin development, we recommend Java 8, as older versions of Java are no longer supported. Be aware that many Minecraft servers have not yet migrated to Java 8. If you wish your Plugin to work in all environments, use Java 6, as there are some end users who have not yet updated.

Oracle provides free downloads of the Java Development Kit on their website. Ensure that you are installing the JDK (Java Development Kit), not the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). There is a difference between the two.

* `Java Development Kit 6 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html>`__
* `Java Development Kit 7 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html>`__
* `Java Development Kit 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`__

Upon completion of the installation process, reboot your computer. The JDK should then be ready for use.
