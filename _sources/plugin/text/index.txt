Formatted Text can be created using the :javadoc:`org.spongepowered.api.text.Text.Builder`, as described in this
section. The robust Text API can be used in a variety of ways to combine styling, coloring, and
:javadoc:`org.spongepowered.api.text.Text` actions.

Pagination, the process of splitting content (such as lists of Text) into discrete pages, will also be discussed in
this section.
