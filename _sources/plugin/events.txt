===================
Working with Events
===================

Sponge provides a system to:

- Listen for events
- Fire events

Overview
========

Events are used to inform plugins of certain happenings. Many events can also be *cancelled* -- that is, the action that
the event refers to can be prevented from occurring. Cancellable events implement the ``Cancellable`` interface.

Sponge itself contains many events; however, plugins can create their own events which other plugins can subscribe to.

Subscribing is the act of listening to an event. An event handler is what subscribes to an event. Event handlers are
assigned a priority that determines the order in which the event handler is run in context of other event handlers
(such as those from other plugins). For example, an event handler with *EARLY* priority will return before most other
event handlers.

Events cannot be sent to a specific set of plugins. All plugins that subscribe to an event will be notified of the event.

The event bus or event manager is the class that keeps track of which plugins have subscribed to which event,
and is also responsible for distributing events to event handlers.

.. note::
  The event bus **supports supertypes**. For example, ``BreakBlockEvent`` extends ``ChangeBlockEvent``.
  Therefore, a plugin could subscribe to ``ChangeBlockEvent`` and still receive ``BreakBlockEvent``\ s. However,
  a plugin subscribed to just ``BreakBlockEvent`` would not be notified of other types of ``ChangeBlockEvent``.

Event Handlers
==============

In order to listen for an event, an event handler must be registered. This is done by making a method with any name,
defining the first (and only) parameter to be the desired event type, and then affixing ``@Listener`` to the method,
as illustrated below.

.. code-block:: java

    import org.spongepowered.api.event.Subscribe;

    @Listener
    public void someEventHandler(SomeEvent event) {
        // Do something with the event
    }

In addition, the class containing these methods must be registered with the event manager:

.. tip::

    For event handlers on your main plugin class (annotated by ``@Plugin``), you do not need to register the object for
    events because Sponge will do it automatically.



Registering and Unregistering Event Handlers
============================================

To register event handlers annotated by ``@Listener`` that are not in the main plugin class, you can use
``EventManager#registerListeners``, which accepts a reference to the plugin and an instance
of the class containing the event handlers.

**Example: Registering Event Handlers in Other Classes**

.. code-block:: java

    public class ExampleHandler {

        @Listener
        public void breakBlock(BreakBlockEvent event) {
            ...
        }
    }

    game.getEventManager().registerListeners(this, new ExampleHandler());



Dynamically Registering Event Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some plugins (such as scripting plugins) may wish to dynamically register an event handler. In that case the event
handler is not a method annotated with ``@Listener``, but rather a class implementing the ``EventHandler`` interface.
This event handler can then be registered by calling ``EventManager#registerListener``, which accepts a reference to the
plugin as the first argument, the ``Class`` of events handled as the second argument, and the handler itself as the
final argument. Optionally, you can specify an ``Order`` to run the event handler in as the third argument or a
boolean value as the fourth argument (before the instance of the handler) which determines whether to call the listener
before other server modifications.

**Example: Implementing EventHandler**

.. code-block:: java

    public class ExampleHandler implements EventHandler<BreakBlockEvent> {

        @Override
        public void handle(BreakBlockEvent event) throws Exception {
            ...
        }
    }

**Example: Dynamically Registering the Event Handler**

.. code-block:: java

    EventHandler<BreakBlockEvent> handler = new ExampleHandler();
    game.getEventManager().registerListener(this, BreakBlockEvent.class, handler);

.. tip::

        For event handlers created with the ``@Listener`` annotation, the order of the execution can be configured
        (see also `About @Listener`_). For dynamically registered handlers this is possible by passing an ``Order``
        to the third argument the ``EventManager#registerListener`` method.


Unregistering Event Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To unregister a single event handler, you can use the ``EventManager#unregisterListeners`` method, which accepts
an instance of the class containing the event handlers.

.. code-block:: java

    EventHandler handler = ...
    game.getEventManager().unregisterListeners(handler);

Alternatively, you can use ``EventManager#unregisterPluginListeners``, passing in a reference to the plugin, to
unregister all event handlers associated with that plugin. Note that this will remove *all* of the plugin's event
handlers, including those registered with ``@Listener`` annotations.

.. code-block:: java

    MyPlugin plugin = ...
    game.getEventManager.unregisterPluginListeners(plugin);

About @Listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``@Listener`` annotation has a few configurable fields:

* ``order`` is the order in which the event handler is to be run. See the ``org.spongepowered.api.event.Order`` enum
  in Sponge to see the available options.
* ``ignoreCancelled``, if true (which is default true), causes the event handler to be skipped if the event in question
  is cancellable and has been cancelled (by a previously-executed plugin, for example).

By default, ``@Listener`` is configured so that your event handler will *not* be called if the event in question is
cancellable and has been cancelled (such as by another plugin).

Firing Events
=============

To dispatch an event, you need an object that implements the ``org.spongepowered.api.event.Event`` interface.

You can fire events using the event bus (``org.spongepowered.api.service.event.EventManager``):

.. code-block:: java

    boolean cancelled = game.getEventManager().post(theEventObject);

The method returns ``true`` if the event was cancelled, ``false`` if not.

Firing Sponge Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to generate instances of built-in events with the static ``SpongeEventFactory``.


Creating Custom Events
======================

You can write your own event classes and dispatch those events using the method described above.

An event class must either implement the ``Event`` interface or extend the ``AbstractEvent`` class.

If you want your event to be cancellable, the class must also implement ``Cancellable``.

Example: Custom Event Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java

    package example.event;

    import org.spongepowered.api.entity.player.Player;
    import org.spongepowered.api.event.AbstractEvent;
    import org.spongepowered.api.event.Cancellable;

    public class PrivateMessageEvent extends AbstractEvent implements Cancellable {

       private boolean cancelled = false;

       private Player sender;
       private Player recipient;

       private String message;

       public Player getSender() {
          return sender;
       }

       public Player getRecipient() {
          return recipient;
       }

       public String getMessage() {
          return message;
       }

       @Override
       public boolean isCancelled() {
          return cancelled;
       }

       @Override
       public void setCancelled(boolean cancel) {
          cancelled = cancel;
       }

       public PrivateMessageEvent(Player sender, Player recipient, String message) {
          this.sender = sender;
          this.recipient = recipient;
          this.message = message;
       }
    }


Example: Fire Custom Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java

    game.getEventManager().post(new PrivateMessageEvent(playerA, playerB, "Hello World!");


Example: Listen for Custom Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java

    @Listener
    public void pmEventHandler(PrivateMessageEvent event) {
        if(event.getMessage().equals("hi i am from planetminecraft")) {
           event.setCancelled();
           return;
        }

        String senderName = event.getSender().getName();
        event.getReceipient().sendMessage(ChatTypes.CHAT, "PM from " + senderName + ": " + event.getMessage());
    }

Callbacks
=========

Callbacks are a more advanced feature of Sponge's event system.

Callbacks allow plugins to cooperate better when they override vanilla behavior. When an event is invoked, Sponge runs
through the event handlers in order from first to last. Then Sponge runs through the callback list in order from last
to first. Vanilla is always the first callback added, meaning that vanilla's handler will be executed last.

Plugins that don't use callbacks can also use the simpler ``setCancelled(boolean)`` method, which will disable all
callbacks. However, some plugins may just need to disable vanilla behavior, modify another plugin's behavior, or disable
that behavior completely. These are cases where the flexibility offered through callbacks is required.

A plugin can add as many callbacks as it needs during an event, and plugins can cancel specific callbacks. However, a
plugin cannot reorder or remove callbacks, as some behaviors (especially vanilla) cannot be reordered. Additionally, all
modifications to the callback list, should be done in the event handler itself. Attempting to change the list during
callback execution will cause a ``ConcurrentModificationException``. Callbacks should only be added or cancelled in
event handlers who's ``Order`` property allows event cancellation.

.. note::

    ``ExplosionEvent`` doesn't exist in the API currently, it is just used for example purposes.


Example: Adding a Callback to Disable Explosions and Spawn an Arrow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This is a bad example, but use-cases for callbacks are going to be very specific so this just demonstrates the code
    needed to add one.

.. code-block:: java

    @Listener
    // final not required unless using an inner class that needs access to it.
    public void onExplosion(final ExplosionEvent event) {
        for (EventCallback callback : event.getCallbacks()) {
            // Disable vanilla behavior
            if (callback.isBaseGame()) {
                if (callback instanceof Cancellable) {
                    ((Cancellable) callback).setCancelled(true);
                }
            }
        }

        event.getCallbacks().add(new EventCallback() {
            public boolean isBaseGame() {
                // Not a base game (i.e. Vanilla) behavior
                return false;
            }

            public void run() {
                Extent extent = event.getEntity().getLocation().getExtent();

                // Create an arrow
                extent.createEntity(EntityTypes.ARROW, event.getEntity().getLocation().getPosition());
            }
        });
    }

Example: Disable Chair Sitting Added by CraftBook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This example will break if other plugins enable or disable callbacks.

.. code-block:: java

    @Listener
    public void onPlayerInteractBlock(PlayerInteractBlockEvent event) {
        boolean foundChair = false;

        for (Callback callback : event.getCallbacks())
            if (callback instanceof com.sk89q.craftbook.mechanic.Chair) {
                if (callback instanceof Cancellable) {
                    ((Cancellable) callback).setCancelled(true);
                }
                foundChair = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (foundChair) {
            for (Callback callback : event.getCallbacks()) {
                if (!(callback instanceof com.sk89q.craftbook.mechanic.Chair)) {
                  if (callback instanceof Cancellable) {
                      ((Cancellable) callback).setCancelled(false);
                  }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Example: Modifying Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java


    @Listener
    public void onExplosion(ExplosionEvent event) {
        for (Callback callback : event.getCallbacks()) {
            if (callback instanceof example.FireworksExplosion) {
                ((example.FireworksExplosion) callback).setYield(200);
            }
        }
    }
