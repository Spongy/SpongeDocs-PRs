Developing Sponge
=================

.. warning::

    This documentation refers to an outdated SpongeAPI version and is no longer actively maintained. While the code
    examples still work for that API version, the policies, guidelines, and some links may have changed. Please refer to
    the latest version of the documentation for those.

This sections describes the best way to approach the project when you're intending to develop Sponge itself. It is
mandatory to be familiar with :doc:`git <../howtogit>` and our :doc:`codestyle`. Basic knowledge of the
:doc:`/about/structure` is also very helpful.

If you want to join us in creating Sponge, head straight over to the :doc:`pr` page.
